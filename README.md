# UIComponents
<h3>UI components/random code that I'd use in the future, kept here for easier access.</h3>
Get real you won't understand any of my code(because I wrote it), but if you do, you can use it too.<br>
Some of it might not be 100% mine, I'll try my best to give credits from where I skidded it.<br>
I'll add folder specific readme's and instructions so that you don't have to break your monitor when the code doesn't work.
Happy skidding!
